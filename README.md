 Car Rental Management System : a scalable application designed to streamline user management, car inventory, and rental processes.
 Built using a microservices architecture, the system ensures modularity, fault tolerance, and high performance. The core technologies employed include:
 • FastAPI: A modern Python framework for building high-performance APIs with asynchronous support.
 • PostgreSQL: A robust relational database for persistent storage, ensuring data integrity with ACID compliance.
 • Redis: An in-memory data store used for caching and asynchronous message brokering between services.
 • Docker & Docker Compose: Tools for containerized deployment, enabling consistent environments and simplified scaling.
 The system comprises four microservices—Users, Cars, Rentals, and Gateway—and a web
based frontend. These components work together to manage user accounts, car inventory, rental workflows, and client interactions, providing a seamless experience for end users
